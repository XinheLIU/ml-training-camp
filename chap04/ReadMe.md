## Chapter 04: Machine Learning Basics

- Different views on Machine Learning - Practical, Statistical, Optimization. 
- The common practice of developing machine learning algorithms.
- Review of standard probability theory. 
- Maximum likelihood estimation and EM Algorithm.
- Bayesian estimation and Variational inference.

### Mathematial Thinking

- Frame and Hypotheses
  - MLE
    - classificaiton, regression could be viewed as special case of MLE， there are other cases as well
  - Machine Learning
    - Empirical: usually use result/some metrics to draw conclusion ("best model")
      - lead problems such as - ignorance of hypothesis (story)
      - sometimes the result reply on data, not reproducible
        - but in most cases, because the existance of big data, are useable in practice
- Elements and Relationships 
- Patterns
- Intuition
- Retrospect and Empathetic 
- Bucket(In/Out/New)
- Strategic minds

### Probability

theoritical/measure based probability vs counting probability

- pmf, pdf, cdf
- mutivariable
  - marginal distribution
  - conditional distribution
- Expectation

MLE

- likelihood
- log likelihood
  - linear regression

 HMM 算法的推导难度
 ▶ HMM 算法的估计方法称之为 Baum-Welch 算法
▶ 换句话说，这是两个数学家折腾好几年折腾出来的东西
▶ 即使知道 HMM 的推导思路，我个人在复现的时候也至少推导了三次， 花了一天时间且中间还参考了各种讲义
▶ 如果我完全不知道推导思路，仅仅知道该算法是可以推导的，我最少也 得花一个月时间才能搞清楚(保守估计)
▶ 相比之下，当我知道 Axiom Of Choice 等价于 Zorn’s Lemma 时候，我只 用了三天时间就推导出来
