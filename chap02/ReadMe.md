## Optimization Steps

"Premature Optimization Is the Root of All Evil" - Stackify 2020

- Implementation
  - number of loops, repeated operations, I/O，etc
- Complexity
  - analyze algorithm details and analyze performance
- Details
  - Hashing, caching, memory, [SIMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD#:~:text=Single%20instruction%2C%20multiple%20data%20(SIMD,on%20multiple%20data%20points%20simultaneously.))
- Parrallel, process and threading

## Profiler-based Optimization

For Python, usually we need to

- find hotspots with profilers and implement using faster languages (Cython, C++)
  - Profilers
    - function profiler
      - no particularly good one for Python (Python too high-level)
    - line profiler
      - needs to break down one operation each line
  - Hotspots
    - hard to link CPU/GPU performance to code lines
    - Python not able to work on memory blocks directly
    - must understand the algorithm
  - General principles
    - analyze memory read write operations
      - [RAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory)
      - [CPU Cache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_cache)
        - we cannot control cache, but caching is usually where the problem is
          - separated memory blocks
          - read multiple times
            - branch predication: if condition changes
            - [cache miss](https://hazelcast.com/glossary/cache-miss/)
      - [Register](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processor_register)
        - where CPU works
    - [SIMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD#:~:text=Single%20instruction%2C%20multiple%20data%20(SIMD,on%20multiple%20data%20points%20simultaneously.))
        - [OpenMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenMP)
        - [intrinsics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrinsic_function)
          - work on compiler
- Do multiprocessing, multithreading （last step)
  - companies share resources/machines
  - frames, server expansion
    - docker +  k8s for dynamic resource allocation

Python Profilers

- Function profiler
  - [cProfile](https://docs.python.org/3/library/profile.html)
    - no call tree & GUI, each line information
    - sometimes not accurate
- Line profiler
  - No good one for Python
    - [line_profile](https://pypi.org/project/line-profiler/)
  - [VTune](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/oneapi/components/vtune-profiler.html) for C++
    - [V-Tune cookbook](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/vtune-cookbook/top.html)

## Cython and C

### [Cython](https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/tutorial/cython_tutorial.html)

- compatible with Python
- C syntax
  - static class
- code protection in distribution
- Compling 
  - Use [setuptools](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) or [disutils](https://docs.python.org/3/library/distutils.html)
    - notice compiler flags and gbd_debug choices
    - [building Cython code](https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/quickstart/build.html)

### [OpenMP](https://www.openmp.org/)

- hard grammar, C-like
  - [Introduction](https://computing.llnl.gov/tutorials/openMP/)
- parrallel programming basics
  - [race condition](https://www.baeldung.com/cs/race-conditions)
  - mutex
